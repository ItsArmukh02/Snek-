This is the algorithm
#first we input the value of the years
x = input("Give the base year's value")
y = input("Give the next year's value")
#now we calculate the change, where 'z' represents the change
z = int(y) - int(x)
#now we divide that by the base
a = int(z)/int(x)
#now we multiply by 100
b = ((float(a)) * (100))
c = round(b, 2)
print (c)
